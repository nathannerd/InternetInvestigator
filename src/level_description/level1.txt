        Hello! I am 12 years old and I go to Middle School Junior High. I am excited to learn new things and meet
        great friends. My favorite subjects in school are art, drama, and english. My hobbies include: musical theatre,
        chess, sketching, and figure skating. Message me if we have any common interests!
